        <h2>Lord of the Rings</h2>
        <figcaption>The Lord of the Rings is a series of three epic fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson, 
            based on the novel written by J.R.R. Tolkien. The films are subtitled The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), 
            The Two Towers (2002), and The Return of the King (2003).
            Set in the fictional world of Middle-earth, the films follow the hobbit Frodo Baggins as he and the Fellowship 
            embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring, to ensure the destruction of its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron. 
            The Fellowship eventually splits up and Frodo continues the quest with his loyal companion Sam and the 
            treacherous Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn, heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, along with Legolas, Gimli, 
            Boromir, Merry, Pippin and the wizard Gandalf, unite to save the Free Peoples of Middle-earth from the forces 
            of Sauron and rally them in the War of the Ring to aid Frodo by distracting Sauron's attention.
